# TP Feedback for Team 13
                                        
**TP Grade**: D+
                                        
## Immersion Design
did not demonstrate any conscious design for particular user experiences
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is somewhat related to immersion design
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed with good quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly analysed to form conclusions leading to future work, but quality of analysis may be lacking
                                        
## Documentation
decent documentation but may lack quality in some areas of the README (e.g., unclear instructions/architecture) and/or video demo (e.g., unclear articulations and/or poor footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
no evidence of properly managed software development processes as a team
                                        
## Other feedback
There were no explicit descriptions (video or text) of what the immersion design intentions were or how the implementation relates to those designs. The only vague information was to infer intentions from the experiential concepts tested in the evaluation.

Good application of exact immersion constructs learnt from class to collect data, however, the analysis falls slightly short as the other valuable information across the other dimensions of the constructs were not discussed.

Documentation - README was just ok but video was lacking in captions/voiceovers to explain what is occuring. Video 2 was unecessary as it simply showed a team member wearing the quest.
Software engineering - did not find any clear evidence of software management processes.
